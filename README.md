This project presents a comprehensive visual and interactive analysis of historical automobile sales in the United States, divided into two main parts. It uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Dash to uncover insights, with a special focus on recession periods.

üìä Part 1 ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In Part 1, visual analysis was performed using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to understand trends and patterns in automobile sales. The main objectives included:

Analyzing yearly trends in automobile sales.

Comparing sales and advertising expenditures during recession vs. non-recession periods.

Examining the impact of economic indicators such as unemployment rate, GDP, and consumer confidence.

Evaluating sales behavior across different vehicle types and cities.

Using choropleth maps to visualize city-wise impact of recession on sales.

üìà Part 2 ‚Äì Interactive Dashboard with Dash
In Part 2, an interactive dashboard was built using the Dash framework. It allows users to:

View either annual statistics or recession-specific reports.

Explore the influence of economic factors on automobile sales.

Analyze performance by vehicle type and city.

Interact with dynamic charts such as line plots, bar charts, and pie charts.
